Description: Explains how to make a copy of your printer in Windows 10 so you can use different settings for each individual printer.

Recently [SendCloud](https://www.sendcloud.com/) released an app to make
printing more efficient and to improve the quality of shipping labels
and documents when using their platform. The application is designed to
be simple. So it only includes only a few features to facilitate
printing directly from the browser and some ways to improve the quality
of printing.

The printing application does not support more complex scenarios like:

-   Changing the paper tray for printing
-   Changing the paper orientation
-   Changing the paper size

Normally you do not need to change those settings, but in some scenarios
you may need to do this. I've talked to some people which told me that
they wanted to use a different paper tray for printing with SendCloud.
Unfortunately changing the default tray within the printer preferences
was not a option as they wanted to have a different tray for all other
applications.

To overcome such scenario you can create a copy/second printer in
Windows. This will allow you to:

-   Set different settings per printer
-   While the same physical printer device is being used to perform
    the printing.

## Make a copy of a printer in Windows 10

### 1. Go to Control Panel &gt; Device and Printers

![Control Panel - Device and Printers - Windows 10](/images/how-can-i-make-a-copy-of-a-printer-in-windows-10/1.png){.image-process-article-image}

You need to open the "classic" control panel which allows you to manage
the printers.

### 2. Click on add a printer

You will get into a wizard which will help you to setup a new printer.

### 3. Select that the printer you want to install isn't listed

![Add Printer Wizard - Printer not listed - Windows 10](/images/how-can-i-make-a-copy-of-a-printer-in-windows-10/3.png){.image-process-article-image}

When you make a copy of a printer the printer is normally not listed.
This is because the computer already knows about the printer.

### 4. Choose the option to add a printer with manual settings

### 5. Select the option to use an existing port

The port of the printer is already in use. Normally you can pick USB001
for a USB connected device like a label printer. Network printers often
use a option starting with "WSD-".

    TIP: How to find the correct printer port
    =========================================
    To find out which port you should use you may right-click on your.
    existing printer and check the "device instance path" property
    within the details section.
    This often gives a good impression of what the correct port may be. 

### 6. Install the printer driver

![Add Printer Wizard - Install the printer driver - Windows 10](/images/how-can-i-make-a-copy-of-a-printer-in-windows-10/6.png){.image-process-article-image}

1.  Select the Printer manufacturer
2.  Select the correct printer driver for your printer

The correct printer driver should be already installed as you are
already using it for the original printer settings.

### 7. Type a printer name

![Add Printer Wizard - Type a printer name - Windows 10](/images/how-can-i-make-a-copy-of-a-printer-in-windows-10/7.png){.image-process-article-image}

Fill in a recognizable name for your printer. Make sure that it is not a
name which you change a lot because applications like the SendCloud app
remember the printer by name.

### 8. Printer sharing

![Add Printer Wizard - Printer sharing - Windows 10](/images/how-can-i-make-a-copy-of-a-printer-in-windows-10/8.png){.image-process-article-image}

Decide whether you want to share the printer. I personally recommend not
to share the printer when it is a network printer.

### 9. Your second printer should be configurable from the printer overview

![Control Panel - Printer overview - Windows 10](/images/how-can-i-make-a-copy-of-a-printer-in-windows-10/9.png){.image-process-article-image}

Your new printer may be visualized as a separate icon or the menu may be
part of the exiting printer when you right click on the icon of the
printer.
