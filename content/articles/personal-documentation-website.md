Description: I created a personal documentation website for sharing notes.

Recently, a friend introduced me to a personal documentation website, and I found it inspiring. I often feel the urge to jot down notes that might also benefit others.

However, blogging can feel like too much of a commitment, and blog posts are usually not updated frequently.

So, this afternoon, I decided to take the plunge and create my own documentation website. I've populated it with some technical notes and insights about the recent mountainbikes that I've owned.

Stay tuned for more updates!
