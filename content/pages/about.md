Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Therry van Neerven, a self-employed person in software development. I also
ride a mountainbike in the Netherlands and I'm looking for a new home for over two years.

This website historically contains blog articles with some tricks to make life
easier. Or things I thought that would be interesting to share.
My intentions are to make this website a little bit more useful from a professional
perspective.

# Consultancy

My goal is bring nice new software to people. I've been working in software
development for over 10 years. So far I had many different roles in order
to get to the result. I have grown a diverse sets of skills and have worked with
amazing people.

My focus is to build high-performing teams and to build sensible products.
I love to do this in a hands-on manner.
Currently my focus is to grow in *product and engineering leadership*.

Companies I have worked for include:

* [Sendcloud](https://www.sendcloud.com/)
* [Jibe Company](https://www.jibe.company/)
* [NXP Semiconductors](https://www.nxp.com/)
* [JouwWeb](https://www.jouwweb.nl/)
* [Logichainge](https://www.logichainge.com/)

Roles that I had in the past:

* Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
* Head of Product
* Software engineer (Full-stack, backend, DevOps)

[CuriousBits](https://www.curiousbits.nl/) is the company that I use to provide my services.

At this moment I am spending most of my time as a interim product manager at
Sendcloud. Me and my team are getting ready to build the next generation of order processing for
e-commerce organizations.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you are considering me to be part of your next
adventure. Or in case you just want to have an interesting chat.
